This repository contains my code for the May Crane fellowship 2023. 

The notebook contains the code for both the title automation as well as the NLP entities creation. 
In order for the code to run for each year, the folders within the Annual Trade Returns and Reports folder must be organized as follows:

```
├── 1923
│   ├── txt
│   ├── csv
│   ├── csv_and_txt
├── 1924
│   ├── txt
│   ├── csv
│   ├── csv_and_txt
```
This means that directly inside each of the year folders (1923-1928), there must be a folder “csv” with all its .csv files, a folder “txt” with all the .txt files, and a folder “csv_and_txt” with all of its .csv as well as .txt files. I made the “csv_and_txt” folders manually but it takes only <2 minutes.    
My report for the fellowship is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9PBRdnILC7uiNwY2Wa2v_X32MCRbGJsJcXPnK29A0I/edit). My slides are also linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qq1VR5LIyWlyXNxO1bxFvNmN3UIIDtFH8Jz3V8lVtXQ/edit#slide=id.g267f48293fa_2_46)
